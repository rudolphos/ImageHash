# ImageHash
Like [VisiPics](https://web.archive.org/web/20140723000216/http://www.visipics.info/index.php?title=Main_Page), but faster.

This is a small Windows program written in Lazarus and Freepascal that uses the DHash image-hashing algorithm to search folders and subfolders for identical or similar images, including cropped versions or those with different resolutions.
